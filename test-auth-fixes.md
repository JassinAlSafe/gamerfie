# Authentication Fixes Testing Guide

## Critical Fixes Implemented

### 1. Environment Variables âœ…
- **Issue**: NextAuth environment variables causing conflicts
- **Fix**: Removed `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`, and `AUTH_SECRET` from `.env.local`
- **Test**: Check that environment no longer has NextAuth references

### 2. Production Domain References âœ…
- **Issue**: Hardcoded `gamersvaultapp.com` causing cross-domain state leakage
- **Fix**: Updated metadata config and sitemap to use `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE` or localhost
- **Test**: Check that all requests go to localhost:3002 in development

### 3. Service Worker Cache Versioning âœ…
- **Issue**: Service worker serving cached authenticated pages after logout
- **Fix**: Updated cache versions to `v3-auth-fix` and added message handler for cache clearing
- **Test**: Check that service worker clears cache on logout

### 4. React Query Cache Clearing âœ…
- **Issue**: React Query retaining user data with aggressive mobile caching
- **Fix**: Enhanced logout function to clear all React Query cache
- **Test**: Check that all cached queries are cleared on logout

## Testing Steps

### Manual Testing Procedure

1. **Login Test**:
   - Go to http://localhost:3002
   - Sign in with valid credentials
   - Verify that authenticated home page loads
   - Check browser console for successful session logs

2. **Logout Test** (Critical Fix):
   - Click logout button
   - Check browser console for comprehensive cleanup logs:
     - "Clearing React Query cache..."
     - "Service Worker: Clearing auth caches on logout"
     - "Cleared all client-side storage and cookies"
   - Verify page redirects to unauthenticated home
   - **Important**: Refresh the page (F5 or Cmd+R)
   - Verify that unauthenticated home persists after refresh

3. **Domain Test**:
   - Open browser developer tools â†’ Network tab
   - Perform any API request
   - Verify all requests go to `localhost:3002` (not gamersvaultapp.com)

4. **Cache Test**:
   - Open browser developer tools â†’ Application tab â†’ Cache Storage
   - Before logout: should see cached entries
   - After logout: cache should be cleared or have new version numbers

## Expected Console Logs on Logout

```
ðŸ”“ Starting comprehensive sign out with scope: local
ðŸ”“ Current auth state before logout: { hasUser: true, hasSession: true, isInitialized: true }
ðŸ”“ Optimistic UI update completed - state cleared
Clearing React Query cache...
React Query cache cleared
Service Worker: Clearing auth caches on logout
Service Worker: Deleting cache on logout: gamerfie-v2
Service Worker: Deleting cache on logout: gamerfie-static-v2
Service Worker: Cache cleared successfully
Cleared all client-side storage and cookies
Comprehensive logout completed successfully
ðŸ”„ Navigating to home after logout...
```

## Success Criteria

âœ… **Primary Issue Resolved**: Authenticated home no longer shows after page refresh when logged out
âœ… **Environment Clean**: No NextAuth references in environment variables
âœ… **Domain Consistency**: All requests go to correct localhost domain
âœ… **Cache Clearing**: Service worker and React Query caches properly cleared
âœ… **No Compilation Errors**: TypeScript and ESLint pass without critical errors

## Known Remaining Warnings

- Minor ESLint warnings about unused variables (non-critical)
- Some TypeScript errors in forum functionality (unrelated to auth)
- These do not affect the core authentication fixes
